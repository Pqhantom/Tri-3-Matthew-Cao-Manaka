On my test I got a 40/50 and while that's not bad it's not as good as I hoped it would be so the first thing I will do is go over the things that I got wrong and see how I can get them right. Then I think I will redo my create task because mine's from last tri is not as good as I would like it to be. After I finish this I think I will spend the rest of the time reviewing the Collegeboard videos because they are somewhat handy. After that I'm not really sure but I'm sure that I will think of something.
On my second test I got  47/50 which is better and so I will continue reviewing.
