My contribution to the group was deployment and then once i finished i did a couple small things like the calendar.

Self Grade Assessment: 30/35  - I think that I did contribute to our pbl a lot however I wish that I could have gotten the deployment finished sooner so that I could have worked a little more on the actual pbl. 

Team Grade Assessment: 33/35 - I think that as a team we did pretty well and that we were mostly on task for the majority of the time. We were able to figure out the database and get a somewhat decent website up for the 3d animation club.
